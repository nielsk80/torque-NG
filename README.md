## ⚠️ Project Status: Experimental Alpha
[cite_start]**Torque-NG is currently in active initial development and is NOT ready for production use.** We are in the process of a "Grand Refactor," transitioning the core libraries from legacy C to C++17[cite: 1]. While the foundational `Libutils` now compiles with modern topology and cgroup support, the higher-level daemon logic (MOM/Server) is still being integrated. Use this code for development, testing, and architectural review only.

## 📖 Project Overview & Vision

[cite_start]**Torque-NG** is an ambitious revival of the original TORQUE Resource Manager[cite: 1]. [cite_start]TORQUE has historically been a cornerstone of HPC, originating from the original PBS resource manager developed by NASA, LLNL, and MRJ[cite: 2].

[cite_start]It incorporates significant advancements in scalability, fault-tolerance, and security contributed by organizations such as OSC, NCSA, TeraGrid, the U.S. Dept of Energy, USC, and many others[cite: 3, 4]. However, as hardware has evolved—introducing hybrid P/E-core architectures and ARM-based clusters—and Linux kernel resource management moved to the Unified Cgroup V2 hierarchy, the original codebase became a victim of technical debt. 

### Our Mission
Our goal is to provide a lightweight, modern, and highly-performant alternative to complex schedulers, specifically optimized for:
* **Modern Linux Kernels**: Native, first-class integration with Cgroup V2.
* **Heterogeneous Compute**: Intelligent placement on systems with mixed core efficiencies (Intel Hybrid, ARM big.LITTLE).
* **Developer Productivity**: A clean, C++17 codebase that is easy to audit, extend, and maintain.

## 🌟 Key Modernizations

* **C++17 Architecture**: Replaced legacy C-style utilities and manual memory management with RAII, standard library containers, and thread-safe patterns.
* **Heterogeneous Topology Awareness**: Integrated with **hwloc 2.x** to intelligently schedule across **Intel/AMD Hybrid cores (P/E-cores)** and **ARM64 (big.LITTLE/Clusters)**.
* **Linux Cgroup V2**: Native support for the unified control group hierarchy, providing superior resource isolation and management.
* **ARM64 Optimization**: First-class support for ARM-based clusters (AWS Graviton, Ampere Altra), ensuring efficient task placement on complex cache hierarchies.
* **Security & Safety**: Refactored privilege-dropping logic (`UserContext`) using reentrant system calls to eliminate legacy race conditions.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

To build Torque-NG, you will need:
* **Compiler**: GCC 9+ or Clang 10+ (C++17 support required)
* **Build System**: CMake 3.12+
* **Libraries**:
    * `hwloc` (2.0+) - Hardware topology discovery
    * `libjsoncpp` - Modern configuration and serialization
    * `libssl` / `libcrypto` - Secure communication

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Building from Source

> **WARNING**: Code is currently under construction. The CMake configuration is premature and does not yet compile the entire project.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nielsk80/torque-NG.git
cd torque-NG
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
